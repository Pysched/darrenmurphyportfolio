# Darren Murphy Portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 
For this project, I created a portfolio website for the purpose of promoting my skills, abilities and identity to prospective employers. The portfolio showcases a number, 6 of projects that represent the variety of skills and abilities that I both offer and have developed. It also includes a snapshot of my biography, personality, education, coding skills and multimedia skillsets.  
## Demo
A demo of the site is available here: https://pysched.github.io/darrenmurphyportfolio/index.html
## UX
In the design of this site, my aim was to deliver a simple, minimal yet elegant website that presents information in an easy to view, understand and logical presentation. The development of the colour palette was designed to complement this approach. 
Colour Scheme to be developed and iterated on to understand how it all could work together. This will include paying attention to accessibility concerns such as colour contract and usability concerns of being aware/unaware of hover states and interaction capabilities.
For employers, I am providing a brief overview of my previous experiences, and my personality, this will serve as a brief “get to know me” to warm and inform potential employers to my friendly and amiable nature.
I will be providing links to both previous web and coding works as well as media related pieces I have developed and worked on. The aim being to sell myself with all the bells and whistles attached, however with out displaying everything in one place, potential employers will get a taste of what I am capable of. 
There are also links to my LinkedIn profile, Youtube Videos,and GitHub profile as well as a downloadable CV detailing my entire working and educational history.

## Features
This site uses a scrollspy feature while changes the active state of a nav list as the user progresses through the site. The nav bar will stay with the user as they scroll the page and will highlight each new area through as visual indicator as the user progresses through the site.
The about me section contains 3 dropdown areas with content within each for the users to explore quick snippets about my education, Achievements and Hobbies. 
The skills section features bar graphs to represent my skill levels in these areas/  These serve to illustrate my skill level both with coding, research and implementation.
The works section, features containers describing my endeavours with the crative digital media. These feature modals that pop up to highlight that in the future there will be content here
The contact section features a form that users can fill out to get in touch with me. This form is content sensitive and will require users to fill all fields and fill them correctly. An error indicator will highlight an issue for the users to rectify before submitting the information. 
There is also a pop up modal that explains that this section is for demo purposes only
The CV Section features 2 button that will either download the pdf of my CV for users or bring them to a page where they can view it.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to add actually links to my works as well as adding images / screen shots as examples for users to preview my works.
I would also like to implement a carosel on the landing page to ilustrate some more examples of my passions
